<h1 align="center">High School Coding Competition For <a href="https://oktsa.org">OKTSA</a> 2021-2022 State Leadership Conference</h1>

> üòã This is an example submission that was actually created during the conference

## Project Tech Stack

* Node.JS - Serverside Javascript Runtime (The project is coded in Javascript)
* Docker - Enterprise containerization platform (The development environment was set up using Docker containers)

## Structure

**All source code is under the `src` folder**

* numbers.js - convert each digit to the English word
* pangram.js - check if an input uses at least 1 of each letter in the English alphabet
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ If the input uses at least 1 of each letter, print the duplicate letters

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ If the input doesn't use at least 1 of each letter, print the missing letters
* primes.js - check if a number is a prime number <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/prime-number#:~:text=A%20prime%20number%20is%20a,factors%20are%20called%20composite%20numbers.">(what is a prime number?)</a>
* timeCalculator.js - for the first input you give HH:MM AM/PM, then for the second input you input how much you want to add/subtract on the first input you added (ex: +03:00 - add 3 hours, -04:20 - minus 4 hours and 20 minutes)
* unitConversions.js - oh boy, this is hard to explain because it was the last prompt and the hardest to implement.
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ we have US imperial units (volume and weight) that we want to convert to metric
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ basically we have to convert different types of units, see the instructions below to kinda see how it works
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ I really can't explain this, sorry

## How do I use this

If you have not already installed Docker, please install it from [Docker.com](https://docker.com)

1. Run `docker-compose up -d workspace` in the project root `tsa-coding`
2. Run `docker-compose exec workspace bash` in the project root to access the development environment
3. Change the directory to `/src` by executing `cd src`


Now that you are able to run the code, here's some example demonstrations you can run

### numbers.js

1. Run `node numbers.js`
2. Input any number (e.g. 420)
3. It will tell you each digit in the English word equivalent (e.g. Four Two Zero)

### pangram.js

1. Run `node pangram.js`
2. Input any phrase or sentence (e.g. Team Fourty Four is the best team ever!)
3. It will tell you if it is a pangram or not
* If it is, it will tell you the duplicate letters
* If it isn't, it will give you the missing letters that it needs to be a pangram

### primes.js

1. Run `node primes.js`
2. Input any number (e.g. 69420)
3. It will tell you if it's prime or not
4. ???
5. profit

### timeCalculator.js

1. Run `node timeCalculator.js`
2. Input an initial time (e.g. 04:20 PM) and press enter
3. Input the value you want to modify the time by (e.g. +02:20 or -11:43) and press enter
4. It will tell you what the final time would be after doing the operation

### unitConversions.js

1. Run `node unitConversions.js`
2. Input a value like `4 tbsp vanilla extract x2`
3. It will convert 4 tbsp to metric (mL) and multiply it by `2`
4. Output should be like `120 mL vanilla extract`
